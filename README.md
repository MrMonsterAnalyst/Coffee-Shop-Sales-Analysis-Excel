#Coffee Sales Analysis Dashboard (Excel)
Tools: Excel (Pivot Tables, Power Query, Advanced Charts, Slicers)
Domain: Retail | Food & Beverage Analytics

Project Overview:
Built an interactive sales and customer behavior dashboard to analyze revenue performance, footfall patterns, product mix, and store-level efficiency for a multi-location coffee shop, with the objective of identifying demand peaks, high-performing products, and operational optimization opportunities.

Key Contributions & Insights:

Analyzed $698K+ in total sales from ~149K customer footfall, validating a high-volume, low-ticket retail model with an average bill of $4.69 per person.
Identified hourly demand peaks between 7–10 AM, confirming strong morning consumption behavior and informing staffing and inventory planning.
Conducted category-level sales analysis, revealing Coffee as the dominant revenue driver (~39%), followed by Tea and Drinking Chocolate, highlighting reliance on core beverage products.
Evaluated order size distribution, showing a near-even split between Large, Regular, and Undefined orders, indicating upsell potential through size standardization and pricing clarity.
Performed store-level performance comparison, identifying Hell’s Kitchen as the top-performing location in both footfall and revenue, followed closely by Lower Manhattan.
Analyzed weekday demand trends, observing strong weekday footfall (Mon–Fri) with a noticeable drop on Saturdays, signaling office-driven demand rather than leisure-heavy traffic.
Identified top-selling products (Barista Espresso, Brewed Chai Tea, Gourmet Brewed Coffee), supporting focused menu optimization and promotional prioritization.
Enabled dynamic analysis using month and day filters to support flexible, management-driven exploration without manual reporting.

Business Impact:

Supported recommendations for morning-hour staffing optimization, core-product inventory prioritization, and location-specific performance benchmarking.
Highlighted opportunities for order-size upselling and weekend demand activation strategies.
